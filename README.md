🎧 Spotify Tableau Dashboard

Understanding music popularity through thoughtful data visualization

📌 Overview

This project is an exploratory Tableau dashboard built using Spotify track data to uncover patterns behind what makes songs and artists popular. The focus is on clear insights, intentional visual choices, and honest analysis, rather than surface-level charts.

The goal was to create a dashboard that feels intuitive, insightful, and relevant to real-world analytics use cases.

📊 Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Spotify Tracks Dataset

File: spotify_tracks.csv

The dataset includes thousands of tracks with attributes such as artist, popularity score, and track duration. Data was reviewed and lightly prepared for consistency before visualization.

📈 Dashboard Highlights
🎤 Top Artists by Average Popularity

Highlights artists with consistent performance rather than one-off viral success.

⏱ Track Duration vs Popularity

Examines whether song length meaningfully influences popularity.

📉 Popularity Distribution

Reveals how popularity is actually distributed across tracks, emphasizing how rare top-performing songs are.

Each visualization was chosen to answer a specific question and communicate insight efficiently.
